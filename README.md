This little code snippet was requested by a friend for searching for
addresses of businesses. Place a list of business names, one per line
in a text file, and run the script with the filename as the first
argument and your Google API key (requires access to the Places
API) as the second, and it'll spit out a list of place names
and addresses separated by "::", one per line.

This code is public domain.
